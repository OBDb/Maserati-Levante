    description: "The Maserati Levante marked the storied Italian manufacturer's first entry into the luxury SUV segment after several concept iterations. Built on a modified version of the platform underpinning the Ghibli and Quattroporte sedans, it features distinctively Maserati styling with an aggressive front fascia, the brand's signature triple side vents, and a coupe-like sloping roofline. Initially launched with a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine in two states of tune: approximately 345 horsepower in the base model and 424 horsepower in the Levante S, both paired with an eight-speed ZF automatic transmission and standard Q4 intelligent all-wheel drive system. European markets additionally received a 3.0-liter V6 turbodiesel option. The interior showcases Italian luxury with premium leather, available Ermenegildo Zegna silk upholstery, genuine wood or carbon fiber trim, and a driver-focused cockpit featuring an 8.4-inch touchscreen infotainment system. All models feature an adaptive air suspension with adjustable ride height and electronically controlled damping. In 2018, the lineup expanded to include the GTS with an uprated 550-horsepower V6 and the Trofeo, featuring a Ferrari-built 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged V8 producing 590 horsepower (later increased to 580 horsepower), capable of 0-60 mph acceleration in under 4 seconds. A significant update in 2021 brought revised styling, updated infotainment with a larger 10.1-inch display, and enhanced driver assistance features including Highway Assist. For 2023, the Levante received the new MC20-derived 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged Nettuno V6 in the Modena trim, producing 550 horsepower. Throughout its production, the Levante has combined Maserati's sporting heritage with SUV practicality, featuring a perfect 50:50 weight distribution, limited-slip differential, and sophisticated torque vectoring for handling dynamics uncommon in the luxury SUV segment, while hydraulic steering (rather than electric) provides exceptional feedback. The Levante successfully expanded Maserati's market reach while maintaining the brand's focus on performance, luxury, and distinctive Italian character."
